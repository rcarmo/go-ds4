# Streaming RAM Matrix

This file tracks constrained mlx-flash runs from `make test-constrained-ram`.
The raw data lives in `benchmarks/streaming_matrix.csv`.

`generation_tps` is the primary speed metric. It comes from the `ds4:
generation:` timing line, not from `/usr/bin/time`; process `real_s` is kept
only as a secondary end-to-end cost that includes startup, mmap setup, hot-range
planning, prefill, and shutdown. For steady-state decode comparisons, measure
from first token onward and avoid treating `real_s` as tok/s.

## Current Default

The current default constrained test is:

```sh
make test-constrained-ram
```

with:

- `RAM_TEST_MB=16384`
- `RAM_TEST_RESIDENT_HOT_MB=8192`
- `RAM_TEST_STREAM_CACHE=32`
- `RAM_TEST_STREAM_WINDOW_MB=8`
- `RAM_TEST_STREAM_CACHE_RAM_MB=4096`
- `RAM_TEST_PIN_MAX_MB=1`
- `RAM_TEST_COMPACT_CACHE_MB=4096`
- `RAM_TEST_CTX=256`
- `RAM_TEST_TOKENS=2`

The largest local test envelope we currently allow is:

```sh
make test-constrained-ram-24gb
```

with `RAM_TEST_MB=24576`, `RAM_TEST_RESIDENT_HOT_MB=8192`,
`RAM_TEST_STREAM_CACHE_RAM_MB=8192`, and `RAM_TEST_COMPACT_CACHE_MB=8192`.

## Conclusions

**Hot Residency**

Planned hot residency is the largest confirmed improvement. Moving frequently
used non-expert tensors into hot mmap-backed Metal views raises the 8-token
first-token-basis run from the earlier 0.37 tok/s baseline to 0.74 tok/s. The
current planner needs about 8.20 GiB to cover all selected non-expert hot ranges,
so setting hot residency much above 9 GiB will not help unless the planner starts
selecting another tensor class.

**Compact Expert Cache**

The compact expert cache is useful, but only up to the active expert working set.
At 4 GiB it still evicts 1024 entries in the 8-token run. At 6 GiB it removes
compact evictions and improves generation from 0.74 to 0.77 tok/s. An 8 GiB
budget leaves headroom for slightly longer or different prompts; the 16-token
optimized check reaches 6.79 GiB compact live.

**Stream-View Cache**

The stream-view cache is still the main churn signal. Even with 7-9 GiB of
stream-view budget, final stream evictions stay around 2740 and stream hits stay
around 75. That means larger stream residency alone is not turning into reuse;
the remaining cost is likely repeated per-token wrapping, blit/gather work, and
page churn for ranges that are not naturally reused by the current cache shape.

**24 GiB Envelope**

The 24 GiB ceiling is safe in the tested splits. After optimizing compact-cache
misses, the best 24 GiB split is `8 GiB hot + 8 GiB stream + 8 GiB compact` at
0.83 tok/s for the 8-token run and 0.82 tok/s in the longer EOS-terminated
check. Larger stream allocations and the 9 GiB hot plan do not improve tok/s on
this prompt.

## Failed Configurations

| Run | Tokens | Cache | Window MiB | Output | Real s | Stream Peak MiB | Reason |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| Wide stream window | 2 | 64 | 64 | `FAILED_PREFILL_BUDGET` | 7.78 | 16320.38 | Filled the 16 GiB stream budget by prefill layer 8 before eviction could start. |

## Notes

- Planned hot residency is the major win so far. The first-token-basis 8-token
  run is 0.74 tok/s with hot ranges, versus 0.37 tok/s before hot residency.
- The 16 GiB conservative default is `8 GiB hot + 4 GiB compact + 4 GiB stream`.
  It stays well under the 16 GiB envelope in observed RSS, but still reports
  2871 stream evictions and 1024 compact expert evictions on the 8-token run.
- Moving 2 GiB from stream views to compact experts eliminates compact-cache
  evictions and improves generation slightly to 0.77 tok/s, but stream evictions
  remain high.
- The useful 24 GiB ceiling now provides a modest speed win after the
  direct-source compact miss optimization. The representative 24 GiB split is
  `8 GiB hot + 8 GiB compact + 8 GiB stream`, which reaches 0.83 tok/s. A
  stream-heavy `8 + 6 + 10` split ties on this prompt but leaves less compact
  headroom.
- The hot planner can cover all currently selected non-expert ranges with about
  8.20 GiB resident. Raising hot residency beyond 9 GiB will not help unless the
  planner starts selecting routed expert ranges or another hot tensor class.
- Stream-view eviction is tracked and remains the clearest churn signal. Larger
  stream budgets reduce peak budget pressure, but they have not improved reuse:
  stream hits stay around 75-78 on these 8-token runs while final stream
  evictions remain around 2740-2870.
- Compact expert eviction is also tracked. A 6 GiB compact expert budget is
  enough for the 8-token prompt, but 8 GiB is the safer 24 GiB setting because
  the longer check reaches 6.79 GiB compact live.
- The next likely speed path is reducing per-token streaming/blit work, not just
  increasing cache sizes. The latest code avoids the old cold-miss dependency
  chain of `source -> cached slice -> compact` by copying cold misses directly
  from the source view into the compact buffer while still populating the cache.
  Remaining candidates are deeper GPU-side gather/compute fusion without falling
  back to full-expert stream views.

## Columns

- `stream_cache`: `DS4_METAL_STREAM_CACHE`.
- `stream_window_mb`: `DS4_METAL_STREAM_WINDOW_MB`.
- `pin_max_mb`: `DS4_METAL_STREAM_PIN_MAX_MB`; small model views at or below
  this size avoid LRU eviction while an unpinned view is available.
- `compact_cache_mb`: `DS4_METAL_COMPACT_EXPERT_CACHE_MB`; set to `0` to keep
  compact expert buffers transient.
- Hot residency is tracked in run notes for now: `DS4_METAL_RESIDENT_HOT_MB`
  selects planned non-expert model ranges, and `DS4_METAL_STREAM_CACHE_RAM_MB`
  caps the remaining transient mmap-backed stream-view cache.
- `generation_tps`: primary decode-speed metric from the program timing line.
  Do not derive tok/s from `real_s`.
- `real_s`: `/usr/bin/time -l` process wall time; useful for regressions in
  setup/prefill/shutdown, not for steady-state decode speed.
- `prefill_*`: counters at the post-prefill memory report.
- `final_*`: counters at the final memory report.

For longer comparisons, prefer `RAM_TEST_TOKENS=8` or `16` with the same short
prompt. That gives decode enough time for cache behavior to matter.
